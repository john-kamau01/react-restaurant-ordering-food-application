# React JS Online Food Ordering Store

This project was built with ReactJS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap. 

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive web application using ReactJS and Redux to handle the state globally. 

I created the store that'll be a container for the state of the whole application. The state included cartitems, total amount and the total quantity of the individual products inside the cart.

I used Redux Toolkit to create the reducers.
